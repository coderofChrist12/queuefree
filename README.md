# QueueFree

We all know how exhausting long lines can be, especially for our elders. As South African citizen's we all know how long we wait to be assisted especially at our government facilities. QueueFree was made with love and care to help everyone plan their trips better, save time and make daily errands less stressful. I'ts my way of giving back to the communiity and making sure the people who cared for us aren't slowed down by long waits.
